<h3 id="overview3"> What does it do?</h3>

Life in Mzansi has several pages of information that briefly outline what life in South Africa is like (there are also links to external websites that can help expand on certain topics.) This is achieved by focusing on the four main pillars of life in South Africa, namely Culture, Wildlife, History and Geography. Users will have a decent knowledge of South Africa by the time they are done with the website. 

<h3 id="overview4">How does it work?</h3>

Life in Mzansi was created with HTML5 and styled with CSS3. There are 5 pages in total that are navigated using the menu located at the top of the website beneath the website logo. This project was developed on Gitpod and deployed on Github. The site can be viewed [here](https://raeel97.github.io/life-in-mzansi/). <br>
The wireframes can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10ZFwIOE_hdAEvLItfB3IiwfM7PaafriX?usp=sharing).
